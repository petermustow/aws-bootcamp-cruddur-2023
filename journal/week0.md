# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
The first week, getting excited to learn more and get into labbing along the way.

## Billing

 
**NOTE:**
- IAM account must be assigned the Billing role to access billing.
 - By default a root account has access to billing.
- N. Virginia region is required for anything billing.

**Role:** arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/job-function/Billing

**Description:** Grants permissions for billing and cost management. This includes viewing account usage and viewing and modifying budgets and payment methods.

## Installing AWS CLI

I'm running Windows 11 and I use Windows Package Manager (winget) to manage my installed application. Winget allows me to ensure that I am able to run a auto update script on my machine on login which will query all the app version against their repo(s) and then update then to the latest version to esure tha latest versions are installed.

## Create a billing alert

**Link:** https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudwatch-estimatedcharges-alarm/

**Tips:**

- 10 free alarms.
- Billing alerts are created from within CloudWatch

## Create an alarm configuration as a JSON file:

    $ cat alarm_config.json
    
    {
    
    "AlarmName": "My Cloud",
    
    "AlarmDescription": "This alarm would be triggered if the daily estimated charges exceeds 50$",
    
    "ActionsEnabled": true,
    
    "AlarmActions": [
    
    "arn:aws:sns:<REGION>:<ACCOUNT_ID>:<SNS_TOPIC_NAME>"
    
    ],
    
    "EvaluationPeriods": 1,
    
    "DatapointsToAlarm": 1,
    
    "Threshold": 50,
    
    "ComparisonOperator": "GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold",
    
    "TreatMissingData": "breaching",
    
    "Metrics": [{
    
    "Id": "m1",
    
    "MetricStat": {
    
    "Metric": {
    
    "Namespace": "AWS/Billing",
    
    "MetricName": "EstimatedCharges",
    
    "Dimensions": [{
    
    "Name": "Currency",
    
    "Value": "AUD"
    
    }]
    
    },
    
    "Period": 86400,
    
    "Stat": "Maximum"
    
    },
    
    "ReturnData": false
    
    },
    
    {
    
    "Id": "e1",
    
    "Expression": "IF(RATE(m1)>0,RATE(m1)*86400,0)",
    
    "Label": "DailyEstimatedCharges",
    
    "ReturnData": true
    
    }]
    
    }

  

## Call the PutMetricAlarm API:

    --resources ami-1234567890abcdef0 --tags Key=env,Value=prod
   
## To add tags to multiple resources via cli

    aws ec2 create-tags \
    --resources ami-1a2b3c4d i-1234567890abcdef0 \
